# 📘 Python Unit Test Automation — Code Examples

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the book  
**_Python Unit Test Automation: Automate, Organize, and Execute Unit Tests in Python_** by **Ashwin Pajankar**.

I am currently working through this book to learn **Python testing**, and this repository serves as a personal learning log where I upload and organize the corresponding code examples as I progress.

## 🧠 About the Book

The book provides a hands-on introduction to testing and test automation in Python. It covers both foundational and practical tools used in real-world Python projects, including:

- `doctest` and `pydoc`
- `unittest`
- `nose` and `nose2`
- `pytest`
- Selenium-based browser automation
- Logging using Python’s built-in `logging` module and `loguru`
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

The emphasis is on writing clean, maintainable tests and integrating testing into development workflows.
